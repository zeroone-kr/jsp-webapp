# jsp_webapp
## Description
For the semester project in the "Web-based Information Systems and Experiments" course at university of Ulsan, I created a CRUD system for USER and BOARD objects using JSP.
I implemented functions such as creating, modifying, and deleting posts, as well as user registration and logout.
While carrying out this semester project, I intentionally implemented it to allow occurrences of web vulnerabilities such as XSS and SQL Injection, for the purpose of studying web vulnerabilities.
